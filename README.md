# My Diploma made on the fourth year of studying at HSE "Fundamental and Applied Linguistics". 
## The current research project is devoted to comparing bi-aspectual verb disambiguation methods: using rule-based and neural models. The repository consists of several blocks:
* Preprocessing code file, depicting the methods of forming biaspectual verb datasets: balanced and unbalanced one. 
* Balanced train (11886 contexts) and test (5095 contexts) datasets.
* Unbalanced train (22807 imperfective verb contexts,	8938 perfective verb contexts) and test (9864 imperfective verb contexts,	3741 perfective verb contexts) datasets
* Bert-like model from scratch with implementation of Multi-Head Attention, Rotary Positional Embeddings, Priority Weighting + Bias, SwiGLU activation and Focal Loss.
* Rule-based model
